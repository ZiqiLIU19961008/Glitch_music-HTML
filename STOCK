AI ASSIGNMENT

Use ml5.js to imagine an interesting/useful ML use case for you or an enterprise, and use Glitch to create a Web page and document your use case by taking captures, include code, links to other resources, techs to use or even add prototypes of your concept.
You can start by studying ml5: Friendly Open Source Machine Learning Library for the Web, as well as the Documentation from ml5.js website, and complete with your own researches.

To validate, your project must:

be based on ml5.js
be correctly documented (it can be replicated from your doc)
be formatted using HTML and CSS

______________________

You've correctly understood the assignment: you are not asked to code an application using IFTTT Webhooks or ml5.js, but are instead asked to imagine an application of these technologies.

I want to check that you do really understand how the tech works by imagining applications and document it using images, code, sources, link to articles,... not that you can code it (it's even better if you can!) 

As future managers, i want you to understand techs involved in digital projects, be able to communicate about it, not necessarily code projects.
